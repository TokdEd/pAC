# 人潮快閃 PAC (Crowd Flash PAC)

Welcome to a modern reimagining of a classic arcade game. In **Crowd Flash PAC**, your enemy isn't ghosts, but the overwhelming anxiety and delay of navigating a crowded world. This is a game of efficiency, strategy, and racing against the clock.

## 🎮 Game Concept

You are the **Efficiency Seeker (PAC)**, a time-savvy student trying to navigate a busy campus. Your goal is to collect "efficiency points" (notes, lunchboxes, etc.) to complete your day's tasks. However, the hallways are flooded with **Crowd Monsters** and ever-changing high-traffic "Crowd Zones" that drain your most valuable resource: **time**.

Use your AI-powered radar to predict human flow, find the path of least resistance, and reach the "Time Exit" before you're lost in the crowd forever.

## ✨ Features

*   **Dynamic Crowd Light Zones:** The map is divided into zones that dynamically change from **Green (Clear)**, to **Yellow (Slightly Crowded)**, to **Red (Congested)**. Red zones slow you down and drain your time twice as fast!
*   **AI Radar Power-up:** Collect and use the AI Radar (`Spacebar`) to get a 5-second preview of which zones will become congested next, allowing you to plan your route strategically.
*   **Alternative Option Tiles:** Discover high-value bonus point locations hidden off the main path. A great risk-vs-reward choice when main routes are blocked.
*   **Time Crack Mechanism:** Staying in a Red Zone for too long triggers a "Time Crack"—a punishing state with visual distortions, further speed reduction, and a score penalty until you escape.
